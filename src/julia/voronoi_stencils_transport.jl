Compute the perp operator U⟂ at $EDGE of $SPH.
Unlike the TRiSK operator, this operator is not antisymmetric but
it has a smaller stencil and is numerically consistent.

Array `U` represents a vector field U by its 
components *normal* to edges of *primal* cells.
`U_perp` represents similarly U⟂. Equivalently, it represents U  
by its components *normal* to edges of *dual* cells.
